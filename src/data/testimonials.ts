  "Escape the Rut is a story of hope, one that allowed me to see that there are no excuses for mediocrity and that God has the ability to lift us from circumstances that seem impossible and grant us an opportunity at a life of abundance and purpose.Following Kimone’s journey of faith highlighted that while God was and continues to be an integral part of her story, it was necessary for her to want a difference in her life. That is the same for us and if God could do it for her, He most certainly can do it for us. Her story was inspiring, moving and encouraging while also holding us accountable for the role we play in escaping the limiting beliefs our circumstances, world views or socialization may cause us to have. I believe everyone should read this life changing story and most importantly put the highlighted steps into practice in order to experience the full benefits of a Christ-centered life.",
